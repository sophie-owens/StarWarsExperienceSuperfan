# StarWarsExperienceSuperfan
This project is my first full front-end website, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. It demonstrates what I learned about DOM manipulation, responsive design, and iterative development.

## Features
- Built entirely with vanilla JS (no frameworks)
- Responsive layout
- Basic interactivity and UI components

## Process
- Followed an iterative design cycle (see `Iterative-Process Slides.pdf`)
- Conducted UX testing with 5 users and incorporated their feedback (see `UX-Testing Feedback.pdf`)
